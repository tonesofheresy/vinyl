This is a website I built for my friend's winery several years ago. The concept for the winery came out of our love for music and my friend's love for wine. At the time, Flash sites were still fairly common and we wanted the site to be highly interactive and animated, so I chose to learn ActionScript 3.0 the best I could and begin building. The whole project took me about three months and required a lot of "hacking" to make sure everything worked the way we wanted it to. There is a record player that I wanted to spin when music was playing and have the arm advance according to the song/playlist position. The "Tunes" section was also rather difficult when it came to positioning the artists' pictures and deciding how to display their names and biographies in an animated/interactive manner. All things considered, I was very proud of being able to build this site and learned a ton about programming along the way.
